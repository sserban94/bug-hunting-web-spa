> (Minimal) functionality  
> As a student i can connect to the application with an account based on an email address.  
> As a student member of a project team (PM) i can register a software project in the bug tracking application, specifying a description, the repository where the project is > > > hosted and the project team.  
> As a student that is not a member of the project team i can register as a tester (TST) for the project  
> As a TST i can register a bug in the bug tracking application. The bug is registered with a severity, a description and a link to the commit that has been tested.  
> As a PM i can see the registered bugs for the projects i participate in.  
> As a PM i can allocate fixing a bug to myself. Only one PM can have a bug allocated at a particular time.  
> As a PM, after solving a bug, i can add a status to the solution with a link to the commit through which the bug was fixed.  
> The application has  a permission system. A PM can add and modify a project, can change the status of a bug. A TST can add a bug.
